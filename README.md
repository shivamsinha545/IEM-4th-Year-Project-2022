# DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING ARDUINO

#### INTRODUCTION
_We have proposed the enhancement of Traffic Light Controller utilizing ultrasonic sensor and microcontroller.The Paper is planned for structuring a thickness based dynamic traffic signal framework where the planning of signal will change consequently on detecting the traffic density at any road junction. Traffic jams are an extreme issue in many urban areas over the world and thusly the time has come to move progressively manual mode or fixed clock mode to a robotized framework with choice making abilities. Present day traffic control framework is fixed time based which may render wasteful on the off chance that one path is operational than the others. To solve this issue, we have made a structure for a clever traffic control system. Some of the time higher traffic density at one side of the intersection requires longer green light time when compared with standard green light time. We, consequently propose here a component where the time of green light and red light is allotted based on the thickness of the traffic present around then. This is accomplished by utilizing ultrasonic sensors which are available on Top of the street.Sometime, in specific intersection of the street junctions extended periods of Red
Traffic Light. In instance of any vehicle in crisis circumstance or on the other hand in emergency like VVIPs,a SMS is send to Traffic Control Authority, who has the control of microcontroller empowers microcontroller to change traffic light green for specific time on need premise._
