# Density-Based Traffic Management System using Arduino
This project aims to design a density-based traffic management system using Arduino, ultrasonic-based distance sensors, and LEDs. The system is designed to automatically control the traffic flow at a busy intersection by regulating the duration of the green signal for each direction based on the number of vehicles detected in the corresponding lane.

## Hardware Components
* Arduino board (e.g. Arduino Uno)  
* Ultrasonic distance sensors (e.g. HC-SR04)  
* LEDs (e.g. 5mm red and green LEDs)  
* Breadboard and jumper wires  
* Power supply (e.g. 9V battery)

## Code
The code for this project is written in the Arduino programming language and can be found in the main.ino file.

## Installation and Setup
Connect the hardware components according to the circuit diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino board using a USB cable and the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Power on the system and wait for the traffic management system to initialize.

## Usage
The traffic management system will automatically detect the number of vehicles in each lane using the ultrasonic distance sensors and regulate the duration of the green signal accordingly. The system will also indicate the current status of each lane using the red and green LEDs.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the system, try the following troubleshooting steps:

Check all connections and ensure that they are secure.
Double-check the code and make sure that it has been properly uploaded to the Arduino board.
Check the power supply and ensure that it is sufficient and properly connected.
